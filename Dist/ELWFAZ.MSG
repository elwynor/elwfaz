Thinking of taking a vacation?

Well, you were, and then something happened.  As a seasoned intergalactic
traveler, you are accustomed to the occasional hyperspace grid interlock,
or matter-transmitter hiccup.

But this is something else entirely!  You were just beaming down to FAZUUL,
playground pleasure planet of the galactic elite, when all of a sudden
the vortex cannonballed, the goonplasm deflated, and the freplishers skrank
out.  You are left standing on the tarmac in front of a large, deserted
alien city.

The welcoming committee is absent.  The vacationland spa hosts and
hostesses have all mysteriously disappeared.  You have reached FAZUUL,
all right, but your vacation is over, and your nightmare has just begun.

As you gaze around in dismay, you may be wondering "What in the Nine
Moons of Jupiter is this??".  This is a multi-user online adventure game.
It is something along the lines of Zork, Deadline, and so on, but with a
key difference: many people can play at once, and they are all in the
SAME simulated universe.  The program that generates this universe is
like an automated dungeon master in "Dungeons and Dragons"... one that
plays no favorites, makes no mistakes, and has the capacity to track a
large number of individuals or groups completely independently of one
another.

FAZUUL was originally a harsh, forbidding world of intense dry heat and
endless rolling sand dunes.  It had been inhabited, millions of years
earlier, by a strange alien civilization of which little is known.  The
aliens all died out long ago of mysterious biological causes, leaving
their technology behind.

Then humans came along, and, through the miracles of kwish-age
engineering, FAZUUL was transformed into a beautiful leisure paradise,
fully equipped with all the essentials of the up-to-date resort planet.

Due to a quantum fluctuation of the void, however, the entire tourist
mass transit system on FAZUUL has been incapacitated.  Vacationers can
beam in but they can't beam back out!

Or can they?  As a marooned vacationer on this paradise planet, you and
your fellow marooned vacationers may be able to figure out the alien
technology lying around, pool your resources and knowledge, and find a
way to escape.

Or, if you like, you can spend your time playing the various Galactic
games that have been installed as part of the resort's facilities, such
as Foon-Ball and Umflungoo.  Or, you may just explore around, talk with
other players, fight with them, whatever you like!

When you see the ">" prompt, feel free to enter commands to your player
to move around (North, South, East, or West), pick up objects that you
see, talk to the other marooned vacationers in your vicinity (with the
"say" command), and so on.  Your terminal will be your eyes and ears,
and will take whatever actions you tell it to (within reason) in your
name.  Type "help" at any time if you need help.

You have arrived on FAZUUL, a lush pleasure planet discovered years ago
by a number of shipwrecked space captains.  At the time of its
discovery, FAZUUL was a harsh, forbidding world of intense dry heat and
endless rolling sand dunes.  Now, however, through the miracles of
kwish-age engineering, FAZUUL has been transformed into a beautiful
leisure paradise, fully equipped with all of the essentials of the
up-to-date resort planet.

Due to a quantum fluctuation of the void, however, the entire tourist

You can talk to other players in your immediate vicinity by typing the
word "say", followed by whatever it is you want to say to them.  If you
want your voice to carry further, use "shout" or "yell".  Everyone
within hearing distance will hear you.

If you want to communicate privately with another player in your
immediate area, you can type "whisper to <so-and-so>", followed by your
confidential message -- other players nearby will only know that you
have whispered something, not what it is you whispered.
} T FAZUUL description


FAZ54 {[0;1;32m...
You move around by telling FAZUUL the direction in which you want to
move: north, south, east, or west.  Sometimes, depending on the
situation, other moves will also make sense.  FAZUUL keeps track of the
last five places you have visited, and gives you the full description of
the place only if it is not one of these last five.  You may tell FAZUUL
to always give you short place-descriptions by typing "brief" (this may
be undone by typing "nonbrief").
} T FAZUUL description


FAZ55 {[0;1;32m...
You can trade crackers, goods, services, and information with other
players any time you like, in any way you like.  Typing "give
<such-and-such> to <so-and-so>" will cause the item to be transferred to
the player you specify, assuming that (a) you possessed it in the first
place, and (b) the specified player is in your immediate area.  The item
can be either a device you are holding, or a count of crackers (for
example, "GIVE 5 CRACKERS TO BEELZEBUB").  The terms and conditions of
any sale are entirely yours to work out with your co-conspirator.
} T FAZUUL description


FAZ56 {[0;1;32m...
The original inhabitants of FAZUUL all perished thousands of years ago of
biological causes, leaving behind odd bits and pieces of incredibly
advanced technology.  The technology takes the form of the various
objects with strange names that you find lying around here and there.
Since they are based on advanced alien technology, their various purposes
may not be apparent to you at first, but by experimenting around with
them you may find that some of them have amazing properties.

You can also assemble the objects together in various ways to make more
complex and interesting devices (e.g. "ATTACH THE GWINGUS TO THE
MONGOO").  These combined devices can then be further combined, and so
on.  A major portion of the information you will be trading with other
players relates to which devices combine with which others, what they do
when combined, how you activate them, the side effects they might have,
and so on.
} T FAZUUL description


FAZ58 {[0;1;32m...
To quit FAZUUL, type "exit", or just "x".  Your player will be placed
into "hypospatial stasis," which means that you will vanish from the
FAZUUL universe but that your complete status will be saved, awaiting
your return to the game.  Any objects you are holding go into hypospatial
stasis with you, so that you can pick up playing again right where you
left off.

If you are lost in the jungle or something and merely wish to restart
the game afresh, type "restart" for further information.

The statue beside you suddenly starts making a low grinding noise!
Then, in a low but almost hesitant tone, as though after centuries
of silence, a voice from the statue says:

     One of two and three of one
     Form a golden tree...
     Harken to the Oddlewokkus:
     Added, they are three.

into your head from some unseen source: "W-welcome to the
F-flakoforeignjive vicarious desert exploration e-experience!".  The view
pans past the city to fill the screen with desert.  "Our intrepid

once-mighty Gastrointestinal Flingducks!".  The image pans over a shallow
hill in the red sands.  "Or here, as we s-see, the s-site of the reknowned

desert indistinguishable from any other.

The scene pans across a dark dune field with strange monoliths of some
kind jutting up from the sand here and there.  "The cemetary of the
Ones From Beyond!  Oolgorb only knows what mysteries are revealed in
the inscriptions on these t-tombstones!".

his side-pocket meaningfully and says: "Well my X-gazax-bits SCROOM just
about that something to say might have!"  The first alien appears taken
aback, then suddenly turns and starts to run for the door.

The scene on the north wall shows the alien running for the door suddenly
flipping over backwards, goods of all sorts spilling out of his pockets
onto the floor.  The scene shifts to show the other alien blowing coolly
across the muzzle of his unholstered scroom, then undulating casually
over to snatch up the nebbish the first one had dropped.  Another, more
mature voice now eases in over the uproar: "Be sure.  Be protected.
Talk softly but carry your X-gazax-bits SCROOM with you at all times."...

tracing a path of three consecutive positions that follow the
figure-eight.  For example, ormush-fong-pleebor is a winning pattern;
but oomwazzitz-neblin-noodiddle is not.  Most non-winning slaps are not
fatal.  HOWEVER: Any attempt to slap the foon-ball just after it has
"crossed the middle" of either lobe of the playfield results in a loss
to the player that slapped the ball.
