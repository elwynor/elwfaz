## THE BACK STORY...

 Thinking of taking a vacation?

 Well, you were, and then something happened.  As a seasoned intergalactic
 traveler, you are accustomed to the occasional hyperspace grid interlock, or
 matter-transmitter hiccup.

 But this is something else entirely!  You were just beaming down to FAZUUL,
 playground pleasure planet of the galactic elite, when all of a sudden the
 vortex cannonballed, the goonplasm deflated, and the freplishers skrank out.
 You are left standing on the tarmac in front of a large, deserted alien city.

 The welcoming committee is absent.  The vacationland spa hosts and hostesses
 have all mysteriously disappeared.  You have reached FAZUUL, all right, but
 your vacation is over, and your nightmare has just begun.

 You have arrived on FAZUUL, a lush pleasure planet discovered years ago by a
 number of shipwrecked space captains.  At the time of its discovery, FAZUUL
 was a harsh, forbidding world of intense dry heat and endless rolling sand
 dunes.  Now, however, through the miracles of kwish-age engineering, FAZUUL
 has been transformed into a beautiful leisure paradise, fully equipped with
 all of the essentials of the up-to-date resort planet.

 Due to a quantum fluctuation of the void, however, the entire tourist mass
 transit system on FAZUUL has been incapacitated.  Vacationers can beam in but
 they can't beam back out!

 Or can they?  As a marooned vacationer on this paradise planet, you and your
 fellow marooned vacationers may be able to figure out the alien technology
 lying around, pool your resources and knowledge, and find a way to escape.
 Or, if you like, you can spend your time playing the various Galactic games
 that have been installed as part of the resort's facilities, such as Foon-Ball
 and Umflungoo.  Or, you are free to just explore around, talk with other
 players, fight with them, or whatever you like!
 
## WHAT IS FAZUUL?

 This is a multi-user online adventure game. It is something along the lines of
 Zork, Deadline, and so on, but with a key difference: many people can play at
 once, and they are all in the SAME simulated universe.  The program that
 generates this universe is like an automated dungeon master in "Dungeons and
 Dragons"... one that plays no favorites, makes no mistakes, and has the
 capacity to track a large number of individuals or groups completely
 independently of one another.

 FAZUUL takes place on the planet FAZUUL! FAZUUL was originally a harsh,
 forbidding world of intense dry heat and endless rolling sand dunes.  It had
 been inhabited, millions of years earlier, by a strange alien civilization of
 which little is known.  The aliens all died out long ago of mysterious
 biological causes, leaving their technology behind.

 Then humans came along, and, through the miracles of kwish-age engineering,
 FAZUUL was transformed into a beautiful leisure paradise, fully equipped with
 all the essentials of the up-to-date resort planet.

 The object of the game is to work with your fellow vacationers to figure out
 the alien technology and find a way to escape the planet!

## GAMEPLAY

 You move around by telling FAZUUL the direction in which you want to move:
 north, south, east, or west (or just N, S, E, or W for short). Sometimes,
 depending on the situation, other moves will also make sense.  FAZUUL keeps
 track of the last five places you have visited, and gives you the full
 description of the place only if it is not one of these last five.  You may
 tell FAZUUL to always give you short place-descriptions by typing "brief"
 (this may be undone by typing "nonbrief").

## TALKING

 You can talk to other players in your immediate vicinity by typing the word
 "say", followed by whatever it is you want to say to them.  If you want your
 voice to carry further, use "shout" or "yell".  Everyone within hearing
 distance will hear you.

 If you want to communicate privately with another player in your immediate
 area, you can type "whisper to so-and-so", followed by your confidential
 message -- other players nearby will only know that you have whispered
 something, not what it is you whispered.

## TRADING

 You can trade crackers, goods, services, and information with other players
 any time you like, in any way you like.  Typing "give such-and-such to so-and-
 so" will cause the item to be transferred to the player you specify, assuming
 that (a) you possessed it in the first place, and (b) the specified player is
 in your immediate area.  The item can be either a device you are holding, or a
 count of crackers (for example, "GIVE 5 CRACKERS TO BEELZEBUB").  The terms
 and conditions of any sale are entirely yours to work out with your co-
 conspirator.

## RESTARTING

 If you are lost in the jungle or something and merely wish to restart the game
 afresh, just type "restart".

## STRATEGY

 The original inhabitants of FAZUUL all perished thousands of years ago of
 biological causes, leaving behind odd bits and pieces of incredibly advanced
 technology.  The technology takes the form of the various objects with strange
 names that you find lying around here and there. Since they are based on
 advanced alien technology, their various purposes may not be apparent to you
 at first, but by experimenting around with them you may find that some of them
 have amazing properties.

 You can also assemble the objects together in various ways to make more
 complex and interesting devices (e.g.  "ATTACH THE GWINGUS TO THE MONGOO").
 These combined devices can then be further combined, and so on.  A major
 portion of the information you will be trading with other players relates to
 which devices combine with which others, what they do when combined, how you
 activate them, the side effects they might have, and so on.

## INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
 
 Simply unzip the archive to your BBS server directory, add 
 it to your menu, configure the MSG file to your liking, and start 
 the BBS!  It's that easy! 

 Fazuul has one message file. Within it, you can define the key required 
 to play the game, and set the ANSI attribute for game text. In LEVEL6,
 There are many text blocks to customize to your heart's content!

## MODULE HISTORY
 
 Fazuul, in many ways, was the software that started it all. It was originally
 written in 1984 by Tim Stryker to power a system called ENTERNET. Not much is
 known about ENTERNET; whether it was a multi-user dial-up system that only
 played Fazuul or if it was a multi-user dial-up system that included Fazzul
 isn't remembered; advertisements suggest it was one game at a time. It was a
 service of American Software Technology of Bay Harbor Islands, FL, and this
 company held the trademark and copyright. ENTERNET allowed up to 45
 simultaneous users. It is possible they were early GSBL / Galacticomm hardware
 customers, but this isn't clear. 
 
 In any event, a lot of the trappings of what became The Major BBS were seeded
 here - state/substate, real-time kick routines, credits ("crackers"), etc.
 Stryker refactored Fazuul into a module for The Major BBS all the way back in
 1986 which means it probably ran on the very first versions of the BBS, prior
 to version 3.05, which didn't finish until late 1986/early 1987. But the game
 wasn't released for The Major BBS until much later due to copyright issues.
 Stryker didn't control it. This led to the development of Quest for Magic with
 Scott Brinker, and much of this game was shared with Don Arnel of Logicom to
 create ZORGON (essentially a clone). The partnership with Brinker of course
 led to the formation of Moonshae Telecomm and 7 great text adventure games.
 All of these games inspired, on some level, and even shared code with, major
 games that followed including Galactic Empire and MUD games.

 Fazuul itself had some variants. The game for The Major BBS was an amalgam of
 these variants like Freezuul, Phazuul, Fazuul 9001. While it was a mainstay of
 the Galacticomm catalog once Stryker was able to recover the rights, it, like
 most of the add-on games, fell by the wayside toward the end of the
 Galacticomm era.

 Fazuul was acquired by Elwynor Technologies in 2005 along with the rest of the
 Galacticomm intellectual property. It was fully ported to Worldgroup 3.2 in
 April 2021, and to The Major BBS v10 in April 2023.

## COMPILATION

 This is a Worldgroup 3.2 / Major BBS v10 module. It's compiled using Borland
 C/C++ 5.0 for Worldgroup 3.2. If you have a working Worldgroup 3.2 development
 kit, a simple "make -f ELWFAZ" should do it! For Major BBS v10, import this
 project folder in the isv/ subtree of Visual Studio 2022, right click the
 project name and choose build! When ready to build for "release", ensure you
 are building for release.

## PACKING UP

 The DIST folder includes all of the items that should be packaged up in a 
 ELWFAZ.ZIP. When unzipped in a Worldgroup 3.2 or Major BBS V10 installation 
 folder, it "installs" the module.
